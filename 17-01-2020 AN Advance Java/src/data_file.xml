            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
                There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their
                exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general
                theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be
                interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest.
                Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in
                the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic
                and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology
                they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>As the masses have adopted RSS as a more mainstream communication medium, Web 2.0 businesses
                and publishers have adopted unique and unusual tools to manipulate RSS content. Here are just some of
                the various RSS tools that are currently available...&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Etiquette for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The arguments continue to rage over the ambiguities in the RSS specifications. But the fact is:
                RSS is here to stay, and the current defined RSS 2.0 specification is likely going to be as good as it
                is going to get. Attempts have been made to create &quot;best practice&quot; documents and specification
                clarifications. We felt it would be helpful to provide general guidelines for those constructing an RSS
                2.0 feed. In general, the following are guidelines for constructing an RSS feed. It is good to get into
                the habit of validating the RSS feed, either with software, or with an online validator. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>RSS offers webmasters a unique opportunity to display fresh content on websites. While
                publishing an RSS feed is a great way to generate site interest and increase communication, syndicating
                and displaying feeds from related relevant sources can also generate interest, increase traffic and
                improve search engine ranking.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Do People Unsubscribe?</title>
            <description>Whether you do email marketing, publish an RSS feed, or both, you will inevitably have
                customers that choose to unsubscribe from your communications. However, you may be able to limit the
                number of customers who do so. According to a recent report by ExactTarget, there are a variety of
                reasons why a person may unsubscribe. By understanding why customers unsubscribe from various
                communications, marketers can learn which marketing mistakes to avoid and keep their subscribers. &lt;br

            <title>Tips for Blog Posting</title>
            <description>Coming up with ideas for new blog posts on a regular basis can be a challenge, even for the
                most prolific writers. Experience shows that readers tend to favor certain types of posts more than
                others. Here are some popular types of blog posts that you might want to use for those times when
                inspiration simply does not strike.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Lists&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Lists are loved by readers. Top 10 lists, lists of top resources, lists of tools, lists of important
                dates, etc. Really, just about any type of list will tend to be very popular with blog readers. And you
                can easily craft lists from popular posts and other resources.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Make Your Podcast Standout</title>
            <description>Podcasts are relatively inexpensive to create, as a result, and the quality in published
                podcasts is extremely diverse. Corporate podcasts can be very polished audio productions while hobbyist
                experimenting with podcasts may have dogs barking and children&apos;s screaming in the background. &lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                After all it is the content that matters right? Well no, not exactly remember when black and white
                televisions could &lt;i&gt;kind of&lt;/i&gt; tune into stations it was just a hazy effect. How many
                continued to watch the grainy or flipping screen. Rarely was the show so riveting did it hold the
                interest of the viewer. Unless of course the content was forbidden to young eyes (as in the playboy
                channel). &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
                There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their
                exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1.) Stay on topic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general
                theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be
                interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest.
                Most readers will not care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in the
                fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic and
                stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Audio File Optimization Tips</title>
            <description>Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website.
                Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet.
                Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings... &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Optimize Landing Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and
                encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to
                the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as
                possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
            <description>Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available
                to them? Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians
                be the victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use
                of the technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in
                today&apos;s society. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting websites,
                indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections. Technology could be the
                deciding factor in the 2008 US Presidential race, and while distribution has never before been as
                accessible as it is to today&apos;s politicians and political candidates, politicians have far less
                control over the news and media than their counterparts in previous years. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The curious need not look any further than YouTube to find the latest political constituents being
                haunted by their own words and dogged by their past missteps. Today&apos;s politicians have far less
                control of the news media and messages associated with their candidacy. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Effective Podcast Tips</title>
            <description>Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing
                behind the show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a
                clean final product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best
                podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind the scenes
                is similar to what would take place for a radio show. &lt;br /&gt;

                Preshow development, while monotonous and time consuming, will determine the quality of the finished
                production.&lt;br /&gt;

<b> 2. Research Interview Subject</b><br />
Do your homework about the individual or individuals you are interviewing. A little due diligence will go a long way.

            <title>What is Podcasting Video Tutorial</title>
            <description>The term &lt;i&gt;podcast&lt;/i&gt; was initially used to reference an RSS feed that contained
                audio files in the items enclosure field. The meaning of podcasting has since expanded, and now refers
                to RSS feeds that contain all types of media, including audio and video, in the items enclosure field.
                For the non-technical folks, podcasting is simply a means of syndicating and distributing rich-media
                files via the Internet. The content contained in a podcast can vary significantly, from a song, to a
                educational lecture, to a political debate, to just about anything else.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS: News You Choose</title>
            <description>Why is RSS So Magical?&lt;br /&gt;
                The answer is simple: RSS is news you choose. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                How Does it Work?&lt;br /&gt;
                Publishers and webmasters provide content and news in an RSS feed. Users view the content of interest in
                an RSS reader or news aggregator. The aggregator or reader contains the collection of feeds that are of
                interest to the user. As the RSS feed is updated the content in the reader or aggregator updates with
                the new information. At any point, users can remove a feed from their aggregator or reader and no longer
                receive information from that source. Ultimately, the user is choosing the news and content they wish to
                view.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedforall.com/rss-news-you-choose.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;RSS:
                News You Choose&lt;/a&gt;

            <title>What Are Sound Effects?</title>
            <description>Learn the ins and outs of using a sound effect to polish your presentation or podcast.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                What Is A Sound Effect?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                A sound effect is a ready-made sound for podcasters or producers. Typically, podcasters need to only
                incorporate the sound into their production for instant success. This can be done with various editors
                running in a very short amount of time. Sound Effects make the creation of a podcast easier and
                professional. Sound effects are usually easy to edit and customize using any sound editor, occasionally
                more sophisticated sound require precise tuning.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Regardless of the size of your business, or whether your company is public, private, a
                government agency, or a non-profit... there is little doubt that you should consider podcasting.
                Podcasting is a 21st century medium, and has proven that it is far more than just a passing fad.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of
                your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will
                contribute to its success.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;Location, Location, Location &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate
                location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and
                relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can
                remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog and RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are
                considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has
                grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and
                reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details
                appropriate behavior. That does not mean there are not acceptable and unacceptable actions that bloggers
                should take.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Create Podcast Sermons &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were
                limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances.
                Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders
                that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost
                on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt;
                We are taught to recycle paper, cans, bottles and plastic but marketers rarely discuss the value of
                repackaging and repurposing content. Publishers and marketers alike have embraced content syndication
                and RSS but few have considered the value beyond the actual syndication. Consider an alternative
                communication channel that reaches a new or different audience. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Quick Questions About Podcasting</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Podcasting is an up-and-coming and increasingly popular medium for communication. The following are common questions about podcasting, perfect for those just getting started in podcasting as a communication channel...<br />
<br />
<b>What Format Should I Record To? </b><br />
While other formats are supported, MP3 is by far the most common format used for audio podcasts. Unless there is a specific and compelling reason to use a different format, you should stick with MP3 files for audio podcasts.<br />
<br />
<b>What Microphones Are Best For Podcasting?</b><br />
It depends on the type of recording you intend to do. There is a big difference between portable and fixed microphones. If all of your recording will occur in a studio, you can use a fixed microphone and equipment suited to that environment. If you are taking your show on the road, consider whether you want to use a portable directional microphone, or a microphone that will pick up area background sounds.<br />

            <title>Sound Effects; The Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be
                podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically
                non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a
                podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound
                effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find
                on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Production and Use of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to
                emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but
                can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often
                synchronized with certain actions, such as a doors slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise.
                Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.&lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Unsurprisingly, the most realistic sound effects tend to be recordings of actual sounds. To create these
                sound effects, the actual sounds that are recorded may also be edited or enhanced; sometimes, the pitch,

            <title>What Can be Published Using RSS Feeds?</title>
            <description>With all the vast amounts of information available on the web, it is becoming more and more
                difficult to sort through and find what you are looking for. RSS significantly lowers the
                signal-to-noise ratio. RSS has the unique ability to compile information and filter it, so you only see
                unique and relevant content. The information superhighway has become packed with content, and those
                familiar with technology are using RSS to filter the content, allowing them to drill down and access
                only the content they want, without having to wade through all the noise. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There are very few subjects or topics that do not currently have an RSS feed available. Perhaps it might
                be easier to ask what can not be published using RSS?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to it&apos;s
                full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and
                managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own
                server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use
                to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Quiz: Test Your RSS Smarts</title>
            <description>You think that you have mastered the art of RSS, but how much do you really know? Take the RSS
                quiz to test your knowledge of RSS.&lt;br /&gt;
                Question: If something is in an RSS feed, it is perfectly fine to reproduce the contents of the feed. I
                mean after all RSS means really simple syndication, right?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Answer: No, that is not true. Regardless of whether content is in a feed or not, the original creator of
                the content has the right to restrict its use. While most people do feel that if content is in an RSS
                feed, it is available for syndication--that is not always the case. Various groups have made efforts to
                add namespaces which expand the tags used in RSS, to define whether the content is available for
                syndication. The two most notable namespaces that detail permissions are the Creative Commons extension
                and the Bloglines&apos; Access extension. These two extensions are not yet widely supported so it is
                always best to check the terms of service associated with the feed or website to determine if the feed
                is available for syndication.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Etiquette for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The arguments continue to rage over the ambiguities in the RSS specifications. But the fact is:
                RSS is here to stay, and the current defined RSS 2.0 specification is likely going to be as good as it
                is going to get. Attempts have been made to create &quot;best practice&quot; documents and specification
                clarifications. We felt it would be helpful to provide general guidelines for those constructing an RSS
                2.0 feed. In general, the following are guidelines for constructing an RSS feed. It is good to get into
                the habit of validating the RSS feed, either with software, or with an online validator. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Subscribe to an RSS Feed</title>
            <description>There are generally two different kinds of tools that allow visitors to subscribe to RSS feeds.
                These tools are known as aggregators, or RSS news readers. As the content of an RSS feed changes, the
                RSS reader/aggregator will update itself automatically and display the new RSS feed items. &lt;br /&gt;
                There are two types of aggregators -- desktop aggregators, and web-based aggregators... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How and Where to Locate Podsafe Music</title>
            <description>Nothing really polishes a podcast more than background music or theme music. In the music
                world, these music segments are referred to as intros and extros. While many enjoy streaming Internet
                Audio and recording songs they like over the Internet, these songs cannot legally be used in a podcast.&lt;br

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Make Your Podcast Standout</title>
            <description>Podcasts are relatively inexpensive to create, as a result, and the quality in published
                podcasts is extremely diverse. Corporate podcasts can be very polished audio productions while hobbyist
                experimenting with podcasts may have dogs barking and children&apos;s screaming in the background. &lt;br

            <title>Effective Podcast Tips</title>
            <description>Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing
                behind the show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a
                clean final product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best
                podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind the scenes
                is similar to what would take place for a radio show. &lt;br /&gt;

                RSS feed, consider using software like FeedForAll http://www.feedforall.com to create an RSS feed. Like
                blogs, RSS is growing in popularity and is a great way to spread the word about a new blog.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
                There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their
                exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general
                theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be
                interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest.
                Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in
                the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic
                and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS More Than Just News Headlines</title>
            <description>The core use for RSS is generally considered news headlines and blog syndication, but
                innovative businesses are learning to use RSS in different ways. Consider RSS as a communication channel
                that can provide current, targeted information as it appears within a very targeted audience.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Set Your Podcast Up for Success</title>
            <description>Podcasting Tips &lt;br /&gt;
                As podcasts increase in popularity, listeners have more choices. So while you might be ahead of the
                competition, you should still be thinking about ways that you can make your podcast unique and stand out
                from similarly themed podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Plan Accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;
                When making the decision and commitment to podcast, it is important to think beyond the moment. Before
                starting, think about the time the podcast production will take.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips to Promoting Podcasts</title>
            <description>Podcast Promotion&lt;br /&gt;
                Podcasting is a great new medium, but creating a podcast is only half of the work. Promoting a podcast
                is equally critical to it&apos;s success. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Educate the Public.&lt;br /&gt;
                It is important to remember that podcasting is a relatively new technology and not everyone understands
                or knows what podcasting is. It is particularly important to educate users if your audience is not
                technical. Not only is it important to explain what a podcast is, but it is equally important to explain
                how your podcast will help listeners.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Steps to Creating and Promoting an RSS Feed</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication as it is commonly known, is a technology that gives
                webmasters the ability to easily distribute and publish syndicated content on the Internet. It seems
                like all Internet businesses now have RSS feeds available; at least your competitors do. You have
                finally made the decision that you have to have one. Where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

                to Creating and Promoting an RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;

            <description>Creating Content&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                New websites are being launched daily. In order to compete, webmasters need to find alternative ways of
                producing themed websites. Highly focused articles are often sought by wembasters. Why? Because content
                on the web is still king! In order to attract search engines and site visitors, webmasters rely heavily
                on providing new, innovative and fresh content. If the web site content is rich, visitors will come. If
                the website content is updated regularly, visitors will return. When evaluating a website&apos;s traffic
                it is easy to see that the low cost of syndicated content can increase a website&apos;s value. Sites
                that contain multiple pages related to a specific topic increase the likelihood of being &apos;found&apos;
                when a variety of search phrases are used for that topic.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology
                they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Where to Locate Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Royalty-free sound effect libraries contain thousands of sound effects that can be licensed for
                specific uses. A customer who uses royalty-free sound effects, as opposed to hiring a sound engineer to
                create them from scratch, can save considerable time, effort, and money. Typically, podcasters and other
                content producers can obtain non-exclusive rights to a single effect, or they can purchase a
                subscription of sorts. The subscriptions allow publishers to download a limited number of sound effects
                during a specified period of time.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Here are a few sources for Sound Effects... &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[Publishing Podcasts<br />
In three simple steps, independent broadcasters can have their voice heard:<br />
<br />
1. Publishers create audio content, posting it on a website for listeners.<br />
<br />
2. Create or edit an existing RSS feed including a link to the audio file in the "enclosure" field of an RSS 2.0 feed, uploading it to a website.<br />
<br />
3. Tell the world that a podcast is available.<br />

            <description>
                <![CDATA[Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website. Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet. Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings... <br />
<br />
<b>1. Optimize Landing Page</b><br />

Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and encourage subscriptions.

Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. <br />

            <title>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Understanding RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS also known as rich site summary or real simply syndication, arrived on the scene a number
                of years ago, but was only recently embraced by webmasters as a means to effectively syndicate content.
                RSS Feeds provide webmasters and content providers an avenue to provide concise summaries to prospective
                readers. Thousands of commercial web sites and blogs now publish content summaries in an RSS feed. Each
                item in the feed typically contains a headline; article summary and link back to the online article.&lt;br
                /&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt;
                In some ways RSS is very similar to HTML, the language commonly used to create websites. Just as with
                HTML, webmasters using traditional search engine optimization tactics when creating an RSS feed will
                find that their RSS feed receives additional exposure and interest. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help
                produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;b&gt;What Format Should I Record To? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                While other formats are supported, MP3 is by far the most common format used for audio podcasts. Unless
                there is a specific and compelling reason to use a different format, you should stick with MP3 files for
                audio podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Step by Step ... How to Podcast Using FeedForAll</title>
            <description>Podcasting is simply distributing audio content using RSS. The process is suprisingly simple,
                and by making audio content available using RSS, podcasters give listeners more control over what they
                listen to and when. Also, many podcasts are available for syndication, which increases a broadcasters
                exposure. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to its
                full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and
                managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own
                server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use
                to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Places to Get Ideas for Blog Posts</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Academia has embraced RSS as a means to educate, but scrutinizing how educational institutions

            <description>There are a variety of things you can do to promote your podcast and increase its popularity...
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Auto-Discovery&lt;br /&gt;
                Include auto-discovery tags in the HTML header of the web page. Some podcasting and RSS readers will
                automatically detect that an RSS feed or podcast is available if such auto-discovery tags are included
                in the web page header tags. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Realtors Employ RSS Feeds to Sell Homes</title>
            <description>Daily more and more realtors are turning to RSS as a tool to market homes for sale. The growing
                RSS phenomenon in the realty market makes perfect sense. Unlike email RSS feeds have a 100% delivery
                rate. In addition the costs involved in creating and managing an RSS feed are insignificant when
                compared to the print advertising Realtors spend on each week. Imagine the amount spent each week to
                promote various properties in circulars and weekly newspapers, compared to the costs associated with
                updating and managing an RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Questioning Online Credibility</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a
                forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is
                in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the
                collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social
                bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Human nature invariably prompts a level of trust;if it is written, it must be true.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How and Where to Locate Podsafe Music</title>
            <description>Nothing really polishes a podcast more than background music or theme music. In the music
                world, these music segments are referred to as intros and extros. While many enjoy streaming Internet
                Audio and recording songs they like over the Internet, these songs cannot legally be used in a podcast.&lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                PodSafe Music &lt;br /&gt;
                Podsafe music refers to music specifically for podcasters. The music is licensed in such a way that
                podcasters can purchase a license to include the music in a podcast without incurring additional fees or
                expenses. In order to use traditional music that is heard on the radio in a podcast, podcasters may have
                to pay royalties for each time the song is played. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hallmarks of a Good Podcast</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[There are many, many things that separate a <i>good </i>podcast from all the rest. Here are a few to consider... <br />
Recording Quality<br />
<br />
The quality of the recording is probably the most critical component of a podcast. A good podcast is easy to understand, and should be recorded at a volume level that makes it easy for listeners to hear all that is said.<br />
Sound Balance<br />
<br />
Adding background music polishes a podcast, but be careful that the music does not overpower the primary content. The background music should be subtle and not distracting. Create a balance that does not compromise the quality of the recording. Also, be sure that the music is not the focal point of a podcast show, unless the topic is about the music -- the emphasis should be on the primary content, and not on the musical arrangements.<br />

            <title>Effective Podcast Tips</title>
            <description>Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing
                behind the show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a
                clean final product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best
                podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind the scenes
                is similar to what would take place for a radio show. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Set Your Podcast Up for Success</title>
            <description>Podcasting Tips &lt;br /&gt;
                As podcasts increase in popularity, listeners have more choices. So while you might be ahead of the
                competition, you should still be thinking about ways that you can make your podcast unique and stand out
                from similarly themed podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Plan Accordingly. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                When making the decision and commitment to podcast, it is important to think beyond the moment. Before
                starting, think about the time the podcast production will take. How will podcasting fit into a current
                schedule? How frequently will you podcast? How will hosting of podcasting files be handled? If the
                podcast is excessively popular, how will fees be generated to pay for hosting? What is the common theme
                that threads all podcasts in a series together? Think not only of a broad theme, but also various
                episodic themes that fit into a broader theme. What will make you distinct or different from others
                podcasting about similar content? By approaching podcasting with a little forethought, you will set
                yourself up for success.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Niche RSS Feeds Matter</title>
            <description>Just as the second generation of search engines and directories evolved into niche topic
                specific portals we are seeing the same occur in the area of RSS feed directories and search engines.
                While some directories are admittedly more niche than others the trend is obvious. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Financial Industry&lt;br /&gt;
                If you are in the finance industry you can monitor currency exchange rates, bank rates and track
                investments using RSS feeds. Financial institutions have found RSS to be an optimum way to communicate
                CD rates, interest rates, currency conversions, and even investors are using to monitor stocks. Use RSS
                to track currency conversions, stocks, bonds, bank rates and other financial related information.&lt;br

            <title>Sound Effects; The Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be
                podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically
                non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a
                podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound
                effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find
                on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Just Might Be the Tool to Revolutionize Education</title>
            <description>Schools all over the country have flocked to podcasting as a new medium to assist the teaching
                profession. Professors are using podcasts to instruct students and get their messages out. Podcasting is
                not restricted to one educational sector, professors at prestigious colleges from Bentley to Purdue have
                flocked to this medium.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                A growing number of professors are recording their lectures, the term coursecasting has been adopted in
                academia. Podcast lectures are used as study tools, and are available for students who might have missed
                class. Some podcasts are password restricted to students who are enrolled in that specific class. While
                other institution&apos;s publicly post their podcasts and offer non-enrolled students insight into the
                class material.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of
                your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will
                contribute to it&apos;s success.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;Location, Location, Location &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate
                location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and
                relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can
                remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Royalty Free Tracks</title>
            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of
                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most
                cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another
                sound.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                As their name suggests, royalty free tracks come without the burden of paying a royalty to a track&apos;s
                creator for each use of their track. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Spread the Word - Podcasting Sermons</title>
            <description>Create Podcast Sermons &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were
                limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances.
                Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders
                that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost
                on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare
                to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips to Promoting Podcasts</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Podcast Promotion<br />
Podcasting is a great new medium, but creating a podcast is only half of the work. Promoting a podcast is equally critical to its success. <br />
<br />
<b>1. Educate the Public.</b><br />
It is important to remember that podcasting is a relatively new technology and not everyone understands or knows what podcasting is. It is particularly important to educate users if your audience is not technical. Not only is it important to explain what a podcast is, but it is equally important to explain how your podcast will help listeners. Instruction on how users can listen to podcasts should also be included. <br />

            <title>Steps to Creating &amp; Promoting an RSS Feed</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication as it is commonly known, is a technology that gives
                webmasters the ability to easily distribute and publish syndicated content on the Internet. It seems
                like all Internet businesses now have RSS feeds available; at least your competitors do. You have
                finally made the decision that you have to have one. Where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Production and the Use of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to
                emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but
                can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often
                synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate
                noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other
                emotions.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Unsurprisingly, the most realistic sound effects tend to be recordings of actual sounds. To create these
                sound effects, the actual sounds that are recorded may also be edited or enhanced; sometimes, the pitch,
                intensity, or another aspect of the sound may be altered using software. Sound effects may also be
                created entirely digitally by using software or sound equipment to recreate the intended effect. Such
                sound effects tend to be less realistic. Both of these kinds of stock sound effects are widely available
                and may be found in sound effect libraries. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
            <description>Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available
                to them? Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians
                be the victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use
                of the technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in
                today&apos;s society. &lt;br /&gt;

                only allows you to stay informed, but also allows you to maintain a strategic advantage over competing
                companies. A number of new Internet services are freely available that make these &apos;ego searches&apos;

            <title>Building an Image with a Logo</title>
            <description>Website design can be elusive to even creative individuals. Sadly some webmasters do not
                realize their incompetence and they post websites that have grainy graphics and turgid colors. If you
                are one of these webmasters and have seen the error of your ways, consider this. Your website is a sales
                tool. A professional layout and design can significantly increase sales and conversion rates, gaining
                you customers. Businesses can greatly benefit from a professional and unforgettable logo that sets them
                apart from their competition. Logos are not just fancy graphics that adorn websites or letterhead, logos
                are a representation of a businesses&apos; philosophy. Logos are a critical component of brand
                development.&lt;br /&gt;

                constantly struggling to stay informed. The quality of content on the web and the number of products
                available to webmasters can seem overwhelming. The goal of creating a site that can be quickly found can
                be a struggle. Unless webmasters have a well-established brand, a great domain name and a huge marketing
                budget, it is important that they appear in search engines via specific keywords. With this in mind, we
                have compiled a list of resources and products that will benefit webmasters in their efforts to be
                found.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Lawyers Use RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Lawyers have never been known as a technical bunch, but more and more often you see a lawyer
                with a palm pilot making appointments and a blackberry for those urgent messages. Electronic gadgets are
                now common in the courthouses across the US. Lawyers have increased productivity by utilizing technology
                so it should come as no surprise that lawyers are using RSS feeds as a means to grow and manage their
                practices. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Lawyers are using RSS feeds a number of different ways to increase efficiency and productivity. Common
                RSS feed usage in the legal field include: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Realtors Estate and RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Why Should Realtors Use RSS?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is little argument that RSS can and will generate web traffic. Realtors using RSS feeds will
                increase the traffic to their website, and more web traffic means more potential buyers. RSS feeds will
                expand a realtor&apos;s reach and distribution, meaning that Realtors will reach new audiences using RSS
                feeds. RSS reaches areas through syndication that are just not as accessible through normal channels or
                traditional realty advertising. Technically-savvy investors with deep pockets keep watch for new
                listings, and they will frequently scan RSS feeds for specific locations. Using RSS feeds, real estate
                offices are able to draw attention to specific properties they decide to highlight in their feeds.&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology
                they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Why should a musician podcast? &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Webmaster Tips</title>
            <description>Unless you are interested in an exercise of futility, it is important to only focus on those
                ranking factors that you, as a webmaster, can control and influence. &lt;br /&gt;
                What are Search Engine factors do webmasters control?&lt;br /&gt;
                Outside of the obvious (webpage title and description) those items which the webmaster has the most
                control are: PageRank, TrustRank, Anchor Text, Keyword Density, Domain Age, URL, and Relevant Links.
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Where to Locate Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Royalty-free sound effect libraries contain thousands of sound effects that can be licensed for
                specific uses. A customer who uses royalty-free sound effects, as opposed to hiring a sound engineer to
                create them from scratch, can save considerable time, effort, and money. Typically, podcasters and other
                content producers can obtain non-exclusive rights to a single effect, or they can purchase a
                subscription of sorts. The subscriptions allow publishers to download a limited number of sound effects
                during a specified period of time.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Here are a few sources for Sound Effects... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Creative Podcasting for Businesses</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Podcasting content comes in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Businesses are finding many different and creative ways of incorporating podcasts into their business strategies and marketing plans.<br />
<br />
Here are just some of the various types of content that businesses are turning into podcasts... <br />
<br />
<b>1. Audio Books</b><br />
<br />
Books that are <i>read</i> aloud are no longer embraced only by the visually impaired. For example, commuters who want to make the most of their travel time have long embraced books-on-tape. The podcast medium is far more compact and portable, so audio books and similar content are now being made available as podcasts. <br />

            <title>RSS More Than Just News Headlines</title>
            <description>The core use for RSS is generally considered news headlines and blog syndication, but
                innovative businesses are learning to use RSS in different ways. Consider RSS as a communication channel
                that can provide current, targeted information as it appears within a very targeted audience.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This
                means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for
                webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br
                /&gt;
                Syndication &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Often, publishers, interested in expanding their base, will allow other webmasters to republish the
                contents of an RSS feed. Content providers that allow for syndication, receive additional exposure, and
                the webmasters serving the content, will generally see web traffic increase as a result of the new
                content. RSS feeds can be syndicated or displayed using a variety of different methods. Depending on the
                web host, server configuration, and the intent of the publishers, a variety of different syndication
                tools exist.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Works</title>
            <description>It has been said that in October of 2004 a Google search returned less than 6,000 results for
                the term &lt;i&gt;podcasting.&lt;/i&gt; Today, a similar search yields more than 857,000 results. Like
                the blogging phenomenon, podcasting has come out of nowhere and attracted an enthusiastic following.&lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                While some traditional radio talk shows have begun providing podcasts of their regularly-scheduled
                broadcasts, the bulk of the podcasts that have cropped up tend to be independent broadcasters who have a
                fascination with technology. As a result, some podcasts are a little rough around the edges.
                Nonetheless, it is clear that the technology provides a significant opportunity and potential. Even
                nay-sayers believe that podcasting is more than a passing fad.&lt;br /&gt;

                Tips for Helping Your RSS Feed Perform!&lt;br /&gt;
                In some ways RSS is very similar to HTML, the language commonly used to create websites. Just as with
                HTML, webmasters using traditional search engine optimization tactics when creating an RSS feed will
                find that their RSS feed receives additional exposure and interest. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Content Syndication</title>
            <description>New websites are being launched daily. In order to compete, webmasters need to find alternative
                ways of producing themed websites. Highly focused articles are often sought by wembasters. Why? Because
                content on the web is still king! In order to attract search engines and site visitors, webmasters rely
                heavily on providing new, innovative and fresh content. If the web site content is rich, visitors will
                come. If the website content is updated regularly, visitors will return. When evaluating a website&apos;s
                traffic it is easy to see that the low cost of syndicated content can increase a website&apos;s value.
                Sites that contain multiple pages related to a specific topic increase the likelihood of being &lt;i&gt;found
                &lt;/i&gt;when a variety of search phrases are used for that topic.&lt;br /&gt;

                newsletter for just under 1,000 subscribers for several years now , but with the advent of increasingly
                sophisticated anti-virus and spamware there has been a growing trend of filters rejecting the
                newsletters, so they needed to find a way of providing the newsletters in a different format.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Videocasting is simply distributing video content using RSS. The process is suprisingly simple,
                and by making video content available using RSS, videocasters give listeners more control over what they
                listen to and when. Also, many podcasts are available for syndication, which increases a broadcasters

                &lt;br /&gt;
                Purpose: The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS
                feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the
                feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS
                readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br

            <title>RSS Feed Security</title>
            <description>RSS is growing at a lightening speed. What was once only known as a &quot;techie tool&quot;,
                RSS is becoming a tool that is continuously being used by the general population. Along with the good
                comes, the not so good. And while some have mentioned the emergence of RSS spam, where content
                publishers dynamically generate nonsensical feeds stuffed with keywords, the real concern relates to
                security. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Creation Tips</title>
            <description>1.) Title - The title should really be no longer than 10-12 words. Use the title as a headline
                to attract interest.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                2.) Description - Descriptions are generally summaries, provide additional information to entice the
                reader to click through for the full information if it is a topic that is of interest to them.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1.Google News &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Monitor Google News for keywords related to your industry. If you find a story you disagree with or
                wholeheartedly agree with write about it. Add your thoughts, and editorialize the content. This does not
                mean you should just repost Google news summaries. The value is not only in the news aggregation, but in
                the commentary that you provide. Tie news items to specific events, conditions, or the impact of
                specific news on the industry. Adding a view point or reference to a news article adds genuine value.
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is RSS?</title>
            <description>RSS is a defined standard with the specific purpose of delivering updates to web-based content.
                Using this standard, webmasters provide headlines and fresh content in a succinct manner. Meanwhile,
                consumers use RSS readers and news aggregators to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one
                centralized program or location. Content viewed in the RSS reader or news aggregator is known as an RSS
                feed. &lt;br /&gt;

                What is podcasting?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcasting is a relatively new communication medium. Podcasting&apos;s increasing popularity and low
                cost of entry makes it a great communication and promotional channel for companies to experiment with.&lt;br

            <title>Realtors Employ RSS Feeds to Sell Homes</title>
            <description>Daily more and more realtors are turning to RSS as a tool to market homes for sale. The growing
                RSS phenomenon in the realty market makes perfect sense. Unlike email RSS feeds have a 100% delivery
                rate. In addition the costs involved in creating and managing an RSS feed are insignificant when
                compared to the print advertising Realtors spend on each week. Imagine the amount spent each week to
                promote various properties in circulars and weekly newspapers, compared to the costs associated with
                updating and managing an RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Financial Companies Use RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Financial institutions are reaching out to clients using RSS feeds. While banks and financial
                institutions are usually slow to adopt new technology, that is not the case with RSS adoption. More and
                more professionals are using RSS in innovative ways, to stay ahead of their competition.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Bank Rate Changes&lt;br /&gt;
                Bankers are using RSS to communicate bank rate changes. Feeds are updated regularly to reflect changes
                to adjustable rate mortgages or the interest rate for CDs.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feeds to Locate Jobs</title>
            <description>In addition to actually seeking a job, there are also other valid reasons to monitor the job
                market. Perhaps you are satisfied in your current position, but just want to keep an eye on new
                positions in a specific sector. Perhaps you are just curious to know what the wages are for similar
                positions. The job market can be monitored quite easily using RSS feeds. You can subscribe to RSS feeds
                in order to find specific company job openings, employment available within a specific region (i.e. by
                using a postal or zipcode), specific positions available, or to locate all jobs within a specific wage
                range.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The following are websites that have RSS feeds to help employees looking for jobs...&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Are Sound Effects?</title>
            <description>What Is A Sound Effect?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                A sound effect is a ready-made sound for podcasters or producers. Typically, podcasters need to only
                incorporate the sound into their production for instant success. This can be done with various editors
                running in a very short amount of time. Sound Effects make the creation of a podcast easier and
                professional. Sound effects are usually easy to edit and customize using any sound editor, occasionally
                more sophisticated sound require precise tuning.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Create Podcast Sermons &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were
                limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances.
                Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders
                that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost
                on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare
                to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme,
                parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers.
                Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and
                interested listeners.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Realtors Estate and RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Why Should Realtors Use RSS?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is little argument that RSS can and will generate web traffic. Realtors using RSS feeds will
                increase the traffic to their website, and more web traffic means more potential buyers. RSS feeds will
                expand a realtor&apos;s reach and distribution, meaning that Realtors will reach new audiences using RSS
                feeds. RSS reaches areas through syndication that are just not as accessible through normal channels or
                traditional realty advertising. Technically-savvy investors with deep pockets keep watch for new
                listings, and they will frequently scan RSS feeds for specific locations. Using RSS feeds, real estate
                offices are able to draw attention to specific properties they decide to highlight in their feeds.&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <description>Reaping The Podcasting Rewards &lt;br /&gt;
                Getting started with podcasting is a relatively inexpensive venture. The equipment and software required
                for podcasting is inexpensive for a business contemplating podcasting as a new marketing and
                communication adventure. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Exactly is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>The term &lt;i&gt;podcast &lt;/i&gt;was initially used to reference an RSS feed that contained
                audio files in the items enclosure field. The meaning of podcasting has since expanded, and now refers
                to RSS feeds that contain all types of media, including audio and video, in the item&apos;s enclosure
                field. For the non-technical folks, podcasting is simply a means of syndicating and distributing
                rich-media files via the Internet. The content contained in a podcast can vary significantly, from a
                song, to a educational lecture, to a political debate, to just about anything else. One great thing
                about podcasting is the wide variety of content formats it can contain. And unlike radio or television
                broadcasts, the recipient can listen or view at their leisure, choosing for themselves when and where
                they wish to listen or view a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                How To Create A Podcast&lt;br /&gt;
                While it may sound complex, the software and technology available today can make the process of creating
                a podcast quite simple... &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Repurposing and repackaging content or information so that it can be consumed through a variety
                of mediums is not a new concept. Many businesses today sight increased communication as a common goal.
                Cost conscious businesses with tight budges are often interested in minimizing work loads and cost,
                while increasing communication. By presenting the same information in different ways and formats,
                businesses are able to increase the reach and communication, while remaining cost conscious. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Works</title>
            <description>While some traditional radio talk shows have begun providing podcasts of their
                regularly-scheduled broadcasts, the bulk of the podcasts that have cropped up tend to be independent
                broadcasters who have a fascination with technology. As a result, some podcasts are a little rough
                around the edges. Nonetheless, it is clear that the technology provides a significant opportunity and
                potential. Even nay-sayers believe that podcasting is more than a passing fad.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Effective Podcasts&lt;br /&gt;
                Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing behind the
                show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a clean final
                product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best podcast
                shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind the scenes is
                similar to what would take place for a radio show. &lt;br /&gt;

                production.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Places to Get Ideas for Blog Posts</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1.Google News &lt;br /&gt;
                Monitor Google News for keywords related to your industry. If you find a story you disagree with or
                wholeheartedly agree with write about it. Add your thoughts, and editorialize the content. This does not
                mean you should just repost Google news summaries. The value is not only in the news aggregation, but in
                the commentary that you provide. Tie news items to specific events, conditions, or the impact of
                specific news on the industry. Adding a view point or reference to a news article adds genuine value.

            <title>Blogs and RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are
                considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has
                grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and
                reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details
                appropriate behavior. That does not mean there are not acceptable and unacceptable actions that bloggers
                should take. In order to efficiently communicate as a blogger on the Internet, it is critical to
                understand the unwritten rules of blogging etiquette.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hallmarks of a Good Podcast</title>
            <description>There are many, many things that separate a &quot;good&quot; podcast from all the rest. Here
                are a few to consider... &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Recording Quality&lt;br /&gt;
                The quality of the recording is probably the most critical component of a podcast. A good podcast is
                easy to understand, and should be recorded at a volume level that makes it easy for listeners to hear
                all that is said.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. <br />
<b></b><br />
<b>1.) Stay on topic.</b><br />
Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest. <br />

            <title>How and Where to Locate Podsafe Music</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Nothing really polishes a podcast more than background music or theme music. In the music world, these music segments are referred to as intros and extros. While many enjoy streaming Internet Audio and recording songs they like over the Internet, these songs cannot legally be used in a podcast.<br />
<b></b><br />
<b>PodSafe Music </b><br />
Podsafe music refers to music specifically for podcasters. The music is licensed in such a way that podcasters can purchase a license to include the music in a podcast without incurring additional fees or expenses. <br />

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help
                produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Quick Questions About Podcasting</title>
            <description>Podcasting is an up-and-coming and increasingly popular medium for communication. The following
                are common questions about podcasting, perfect for those just getting started in podcasting as a
                communication channel...&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What Format Should I Record To? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                While other formats are supported, MP3 is by far the most common format used for audio podcasts. Unless
                there is a specific and compelling reason to use a different format, you should stick with MP3 files for
                audio podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Royalty Free Tracks</title>
            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of
                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most
                cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another
                sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of
                your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will
                contribute to it&apos;s success.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Location, Location, Location &lt;br /&gt;
                When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate
                location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and
                relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can
                remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>It is All About Content Syndication</title>
            <description>Creating Content&lt;br /&gt;
                New websites are being launched daily. In order to compete, webmasters need to find alternative ways of
                producing themed websites. Highly focused articles are often sought by wembasters. Why? Because content
                on the web is still king! In order to attract search engines and site visitors, webmasters rely heavily
                on providing new, innovative and fresh content. If the web site content is rich, visitors will come. If
                the website content is updated regularly, visitors will return. When evaluating a website&apos;s traffic
                it is easy to see that the low cost of syndicated content can increase a website&apos;s value. Sites
                that contain multiple pages related to a specific topic increase the likelihood of being &apos;found&apos;
                when a variety of search phrases are used for that topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                By creating a niche resource, webmasters are viewed as industry experts and their websites are more
                likely to receive incoming directory links. A number of publishers provide free content, the only
                stipulation being that the webmaster serving the content must include the author resource box.
                Webmasters utilizing free content can easily create portals teeming with themed content.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Use RSS?</title>
            <description>RSS streamlines communication between publishers and readers. Since RSS has had a popularity
                surge, webmasters have been experimenting and using RSS feeds to deliver content in new and innovative
                ways. Typically, RSS feeds contain news headlines and content summaries. The content summaries contain
                just enough information without overwhelming the reader with superfluous details. If the reader is
                interested and wants additional information they can click on the item in the feed, accessing the
                website which contains additional details. RSS readers aggregate multiple feeds, making it easy for
                individuals to quickly scan information contained within each feed. Feeds are generally themed, allowing
                users to opt-in to feeds that are of interest. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their

                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web

            <description>You have an RSS feed and you have worked hard to get the word out. According to your logs you

                A consistent stream of original content will do well to earn subscribers loyalty. The best RSS feeds
                provide content that is compelling and unique. Do not rehash existing content, look for a unique angle

            <title>Personal Namespace Extension</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS
                feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the
                feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS
                readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br

            <title>Advertising in RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>As publishers have moved towards monetizing RSS feeds, their have been vibrant discussions as
                to whether advertisements in feeds are viable or whether they will drive subscribers away. At the end of
                the day while it appears that many are discussing the philosophical approaches to ads in RSS feeds few
                are taking the time to examine the options available for inserting advertisements in feeds. Ultimately
                the advertisements served are going to determine the success of RSS as an advertising medium. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Podcasting is simply distributing audio content using RSS. The process is suprisingly simple,
                and by making audio content available using RSS, podcasters give listeners more control over what they
                listen to and when. Also, many podcasts are available for syndication, which increases a broadcasters
                exposure. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Monetizing Podcasts</title>
            <description>Podcasts started out as fun ways for ambitious garage DJs, independent musicians and talk show
                hosts, who had not ventured into radio broadcasting as a way to show their stuff and make a name for
                themselves. What started as a hobby for many, has turned into a lucrative profession for some.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, podcasters, just like radio stations, have looked for ways to profit from their on-air
                dialogue. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Do I Promote My Podcast?</title>
            <description>There are a variety of things you can do to promote your podcast and increase its popularity...
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Auto-Discovery&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Include auto-discovery tags in the HTML header of the web page. Some podcasting and RSS readers will
                automatically detect that an RSS feed or podcast is available if such auto-discovery tags are included
                in the web page header tags. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Schools all over the country have flocked to podcasting as a new medium to assist the teaching
                profession. Professors are using podcasts to instruct students and get their messages out. Podcasting is
                not restricted to one educational sector, professors at prestigious colleges from Bentley to Purdue have
                flocked to this medium.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                A growing number of professors are recording their lectures, the term coursecasting has been adopted in
                academia. Podcast lectures are used as study tools, and are available for students who might have missed
                class. Some podcasts are password restricted to students who are enrolled in that specific class.&lt;br

            <description>We are taught to recycle paper, cans, bottles and plastic but marketers rarely discuss the
                value of repackaging and repurposing content. Publishers and marketers alike have embraced content
                syndication and RSS but few have considered the value beyond the actual syndication. Consider an
                alternative communication channel that reaches a new or different audience. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sound Effects; The Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be
                podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically
                non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a
                podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound
                effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find
                on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Production and Use of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to
                emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but
                can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often
                synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate
                noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other
                emotions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology
                they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Whether you do email marketing, publish an RSS feed, or both, you will inevitably have
                customers that choose to unsubscribe from your communications. However, you may be able to limit the
                number of customers who do so. According to a recent report by ExactTarget, there are a variety of
                reasons why a person may unsubscribe. By understanding why customers unsubscribe from various
                communications, marketers can learn which marketing mistakes to avoid and keep their subscribers. &lt;br

            <title>Search Engine Optimization for RSS</title>
            <description>Tips for Helping Your RSS Feed Perform!&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In some ways RSS is very similar to HTML, the language commonly used to create websites. Just as with
                HTML, webmasters using traditional search engine optimization tactics when creating an RSS feed will
                find that their RSS feed receives additional exposure and interest. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How and Where to Locate Podsafe Music</title>
            <description>Nothing really polishes a podcast more than background music or theme music. In the music
                world, these music segments are referred to as intros and extros. While many enjoy streaming Internet
                Audio and recording songs they like over the Internet, these songs cannot legally be used in a podcast.&lt;br

            <description>RSS offers webmasters a unique opportunity to display fresh content on websites. While
                publishing an RSS feed is a great way to generate site interest and increase communication, syndicating
                and displaying feeds from related relevant sources can also generate interest, increase traffic and
                improve search engine ranking.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help
                produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Sermons</title>
            <description>Create Podcast Sermons &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were
                limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances.
                Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders
                that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost
                on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare
                to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme,
                parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers.
                Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and
                interested listeners.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Works?</title>
            <description>It has been said that in October of 2004 a Google search returned less than 6,000 results for
                the term &lt;i&gt;podcasting&lt;/i&gt;. Today, a similar search yields more than 857,000 results. Like
                the blogging phenomenon, podcasting has come out of nowhere and attracted an enthusiastic following.&lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                While some traditional radio talk shows have begun providing podcasts of their regularly-scheduled
                broadcasts, the bulk of the podcasts that have cropped up tend to be independent broadcasters who have a
                fascination with technology. As a result, some podcasts are a little rough around the edges.
                Nonetheless, it is clear that the technology provides a significant opportunity and potential. Even
                nay-sayers believe that podcasting is more than a passing fad.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their
                exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general
                theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be
                interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest.
                Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in
                the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic
                and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

                technically knowledgeable online surfers have begun incorporating RSS into their daily routines. Why go
                through the hassle of understanding something new, the novice might want to know? Because it saves time,
                and time is a precious commodity these days.&lt;br /&gt;
                The contents of an RSS feed can be read any number of ways. A variety of tools, both fee based and free,
                to read RSS feeds are available on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Content Syndication</title>
            <description>Creating Content&lt;br /&gt;
                New websites are being launched daily. In order to compete, webmasters need to find alternative ways of
                producing themed websites. Highly focused articles are often sought by wembasters. Why? Because content
                on the web is still king! In order to attract search engines and site visitors, webmasters rely heavily
                on providing new, innovative and fresh content. If the web site content is rich, visitors will come. If
                the website content is updated regularly, visitors will return. When evaluating a websites traffic it is
                easy to see that the low cost of syndicated content can increase a websites value. Sites that contain
                multiple pages related to a specific topic increase the likelihood of being &apos;found&apos; when a
                variety of search phrases are used for that topic.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This
                means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for
                webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>RSS Security</title>
            <description>RSS is growing at a lightening speed. What was once only known as a &lt;i&gt;techie tool&lt;/i&gt;,
                RSS is becoming a tool that is continuously being used by the general population. Along with the good
                comes, the not so good. And while some have mentioned the emergence of RSS spam, where content
                publishers dynamically generate nonsensical feeds stuffed with keywords, the real concern relates to
                security. While an annoyance to the search engines, spam in RSS feeds pales in comparison to the
                possible security concerns that could be in RSS future. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Is More Than Just News</title>
            <description>The core use for RSS is generally considered news headlines and blog syndication, but
                innovative businesses are learning to use RSS in different ways. Consider RSS as a communication channel
                that can provide current, targeted information as it appears within a very targeted audience.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog and RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are
                considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has
                grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and
                reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details
                appropriate behavior. That does not mean there are not acceptable and unacceptable actions that bloggers
                should take. In order to efficiently communicate as a blogger on the Internet, it is critical to
                understand the unwritten rules of blogging etiquette.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>Publicize your RSS feed. &lt;br /&gt;
                There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve
                made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;br /&gt;
                This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link
                popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS
                directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds. Feeds are generally categorized and grouped
                together by subject.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Steps to Creating and Promoting RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication as it is commonly known, is a technology that gives
                webmasters the ability to easily distribute and publish syndicated content on the Internet. It seems
                like all Internet businesses now have RSS feeds available; at least your competitors do. You have
                finally made the decision that you have to have one. Where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Effective Podcast Tips</title>
            <description>Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing
                behind the show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a
                clean final product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best
                podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind the scenes
                is similar to what would take place for a radio show. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Audio File Optimization Tips</title>
            <description>Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website.
                Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet.
                Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings... &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Optimize Landing Page&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and
                encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to
                the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as
                possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Promote A Blog</title>
            <description>Syndication is conceptually simple. It allows publishers to distribute content that can be
                displayed in another location or context. Using RSS, publishers are able to easily create and
                disseminate content feeds that include news headlines, blog summaries and related links. RSS is the
                defined syndication standard that has become mainstream. All types of information are now available in a
                syndicated format.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting is Used</title>
            <description>Although podcasting is new, it is well on its way to becoming a mainstream communication
                medium. Podcasting, simply put, is audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe that
                podcasting is solely for the distribution of music files, but really, nothing could be further from the
                truth. This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and
                communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are
                technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses
                are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk
                shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign
                language tutorials. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                While RSS has had the capacity to include audio files for a few years, only recently have entrepreneurs
                made the conceptual leap, taking advantage of the new power held within this communication medium. In
                reality, podcasters cover the gamut; some are professional broadcasters, while others are obvious
                amateurs.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Attention Getting Blog Posts</title>
            <description>Blogs are now a dime a dozen, and bloggers need to make their blog posts stand out. Developing
                a blog following is not as easy as it once was. Learn how to write blog posts that attract readers and
                retain their attention. Follow these guidelines to cultivate readers... &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Draw Attention&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Use titles to attract the reader&apos;s attention to the blog post. The title should mimic newspaper
                headlines and generate interest in the blog post. The title can be controversial, but not to the extent
                of being misleading. Use action words in the title. Bloggers will often come up with a handful of
                potential titles for blog posts, and then settle on the title that is best suited to a particular blog
                post. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hallmarks of a Good Podast</title>
            <description>There are many, many things that separate a &quot;good&quot; podcast from all the rest. Here
                are a few to consider... &lt;br /&gt;
                Recording Quality&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The quality of the recording is probably the most critical component of a podcast. A good podcast is
                easy to understand, and should be recorded at a volume level that makes it easy for listeners to hear
                all that is said.&lt;br /&gt;
                Sound Balance&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Adding background music polishes a podcast, but be careful that the music does not overpower the primary
                content. The background music should be subtle and not distracting. Create a balance that does not
                compromise the quality of the recording. Also, be sure that the music is not the focal point of a
                podcast show, unless the topic is about the music -- the emphasis should be on the primary content, and
                not on the musical arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Niche RSS Feeds Matter?</title>
            <description>Just as the second generation of search engines and directories evolved into niche topic
                specific portals we are seeing the same occur in the area of RSS feed directories and search engines.
                While some directories are admittedly more niche than others the trend is obvious.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Do People Unsubscribe?</title>
            <description>Whether you do email marketing, publish an RSS feed, or both, you will inevitably have
                customers that choose to unsubscribe from your communications. However, you may be able to limit the
                number of customers who do so. According to a recent report by ExactTarget, there are a variety of
                reasons why a person may unsubscribe. By understanding why customers unsubscribe from various
                communications, marketers can learn which marketing mistakes to avoid and keep their subscribers. &lt;br

            <description>RSS feeds are a great communication medium, and when properly managed, web feeds can bring in

            <title>RSS Innovation</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a new way to broadcast corporate news and structured
                information. RSS offers a quick, easy corporate communication channel. The RSS contents are published as
                a feed and the feed&apos;s content keep customers, partners and journalists abreast of corporate news
                and information. The RSS feeds are read using a tool referred to as a news aggregator, or an RSS reader.
                The aggregator periodically checks to see if the RSS feed has been updated. As the feed is updated, new
                information will automatically appear in the RSS reader. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips to Promoting Podcasts</title>
            <description>&lt;br /&gt;
                Podcasting is a great new medium, but creating a podcast is only half of the work. Promoting a podcast
                is equally critical to it&apos;s success. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Educate the Public.&lt;br /&gt;
                It is important to remember that podcasting is a relatively new technology and not everyone understands
                or knows what podcasting is. It is particularly important to educate users if your audience is not
                technical. Not only is it important to explain what a podcast is, but it is equally important to explain
                how your podcast will help listeners. Instruction on how users can listen to podcasts should also be
                included. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Exactly is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>For the non-technical folks, podcasting is simply a means of syndicating and distributing
                rich-media files via the Internet. The content contained in a podcast can vary significantly, from a
                song, to a educational lecture, to a political debate, to just about anything else. One great thing
                about podcasting is the wide variety of content formats it can contain. And unlike radio or television
                broadcasts, the recipient can listen or view at their leisure, choosing for themselves when and where
                they wish to listen or view a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sound Effects; The Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be
                podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically
                non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a
                podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound
                effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find
                on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This
                means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for
                webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br
                /&gt;
                Syndication &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Often, publishers, interested in expanding their base, will allow other webmasters to republish the
                contents of an RSS feed. Content providers that allow for syndication, receive additional exposure, and
                the webmasters serving the content, will generally see web traffic increase as a result of the new
                content. RSS feeds can be syndicated or displayed using a variety of different methods. Depending on the
                web host, server configuration, and the intent of the publishers, a variety of different syndication
                tools exist.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Search Engine Optimization for RSS</title>
            <description>Tips for Helping Your RSS Feed Perform!&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In some ways RSS is very similar to HTML, the language commonly used to create websites. Just as with
                HTML, webmasters using traditional search engine optimization tactics when creating an RSS feed will
                find that their RSS feed receives additional exposure and interest. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Simple steps to optimize an RSS feed for search engines:&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Royalty Free Tracks</title>
            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of
                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most
                cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another
                sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Lawyers Use RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Lawyers have never been known as a technical bunch, but more and more often you see a lawyer
                with a palm pilot making appointments and a blackberry for those urgent messages. Electronic gadgets are
                now common in the courthouses across the US. Lawyers have increased productivity by utilizing technology
                so it should come as no surprise that lawyers are using RSS feeds as a means to grow and manage their
                practices. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Blogs have increased in popularity because they provide a steady stream of new and unique
                content. The only issue presented by this quality of blogs is that it may become difficult for those who
                run blogs to think of interesting and novel posts. If you have jumped on the blogging bandwagon but
                suffer writer&apos;s block, do not panic: we have created a list of 26 ideas for blog posts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Measuring RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Measuring and tracking RSS while a fairly simple concept, is really anything but. Unlike
                websites, RSS have the added caveat of potential syndication, making accurate tracking a challenge to
                anyone but the extremely tech savvy. It is not unrealistic for marketers to want to know how many
                subscribers they have, which items in their feeds attract the most interest, or how many click-throughs
                are generated as a result of an RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS: News You Choose</title>
            <description>How Does it Work?&lt;br /&gt;
                Publishers and webmasters provide content and news in an RSS feed. Users view the content of interest in
                an RSS reader or news aggregator. The aggregator or reader contains the collection of feeds that are of
                interest to the user. As the RSS feed is updated the content in the reader or aggregator updates with
                the new information. At any point, users can remove a feed from their aggregator or reader and no longer
                receive information from that source. Ultimately, the user is choosing the news and content they wish to
                view.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Just Might Be the Tool to Revolutionize Education</title>
            <description>Schools all over the country have flocked to podcasting as a new medium to assist the teaching
                profession. Professors are using podcasts to instruct students and get their messages out. Podcasting is
                not restricted to one educational sector, professors at prestigious colleges from Bentley to Purdue have
                flocked to this medium.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                A growing number of professors are recording their lectures, the term coursecasting has been adopted in
                academia. Podcast lectures are used as study tools, and are available for students who might have missed
                class. Some podcasts are password restricted to students who are enrolled in that specific class. While
                other institution&apos;s publicly post their podcasts and offer non-enrolled students insight into the
                class material.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt;
                We are taught to recycle paper, cans, bottles and plastic but marketers rarely discuss the value of
                repackaging and repurposing content. Publishers and marketers alike have embraced content syndication
                and RSS but few have considered the value beyond the actual syndication. Consider an alternative
                communication channel that reaches a new or different audience. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
                There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their
                exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general
                theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be
                interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest.
                Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in
                the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic
                and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology
                they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is the Difference Between RSS and XML?</title>
            <description>XML is a standard that defines how to structure a text document using tags, to store
                information in a organized way in that document.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                RSS follows that XML standard, but goes further....&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting is Used</title>
            <description>Although podcasting is new, it is well on its way to becoming a mainstream communication
                medium. Podcasting, simply put, is audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe that
                podcasting is solely for the distribution of music files, but really, nothing could be further from the
                truth. This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and
                communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are
                technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses
                are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk
                shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign
                language tutorials. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                While RSS has had the capacity to include audio files for a few years, only recently have entrepreneurs
                made the conceptual leap, taking advantage of the new power held within this communication medium. In
                reality, podcasters cover the gamut; some are professional broadcasters, while others are obvious
                amateurs. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Tips to Help Search Engine Optimization</title>
            <description>RSS feeds are a great communication medium, and when properly managed, web feeds can bring in
                significant Internet traffic. RSS feeds should contain compelling themed content with episodic titles
                that are united in common broad theme. Use RSS feeds as an online marketing and search engine
                optimization tool. Just as optimizing an HTML web page will increase exposure, so too will an RSS feed
                that is properly optimized and promoted. Use these simple tips to improve your web feed exposure. &lt;br

            <title>Production and Use of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to
                emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but
                can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often
                synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate
                noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other
                emotions.&lt;br /&gt;

                It can be tricky to predict what content will perform well on social bookmarking websites. The interests
                of our democratic populace are widespread and constantly changing. Webpages, podcasts, and images which
                are deemed more newsworthy, humorous, or intriguing often steal the spotlight. Knowing how to present

            <title>Re-Using Content</title>
            <description>Repurposing content is not a terribly new concept. Webmasters that picked up on the trend have
                benefited from traffic surges for a while now. Repurposing content is all about presenting the same
                content in a variety of different ways, or using different mediums to present the same content.
                Webmasters can manipulate content in order to provide the same content in any number of different
                formats. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Why would publishers want to do this? There are a number of benefits to repurposing content, not the
                least of which is that it allows customers to select the format they wish to access your information.
                Additionally, repurposing content often does not require a lot of extra time, expense, or additional
                effort. The content itself already exists -- the format is just different. Additionally, there are a
                number of software tools available that can assist users in easily repurposing the content. &lt;br /&gt;

                than in the real estate industry. Realtors who flocked to the latest technologies, adopted them, and
                applied them in order to enhance and sell property, are still prospering.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Using the latest technology, realtors can show a home&apos;s finest attributes via Video Podcasting.
                Video Podcasting is a compelling distribution channel that allows realtors to reach a large audience
                while showcasing a property&apos;s best features. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Create Podcast Sermons &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were
                limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances.
                Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>In addition to making your RSS feed available to your visitors for use with their RSS Feed
                Reader, as a webmaster you may also want to make the same feed available on your website for viewing
                with a regular web browser. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There are several ways to do this, some have advantages or disadvantages compared to others. The best
                solution is one where the webpage is automatically updated on-the-fly, is easily spidered by search

            <title>Royalty Free Tracks</title>
            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of
                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most
                cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another
                sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Video Optimization - Part 2</title>
            <description>Optimizing your video for search engines will increase the exposure that the video receives,
                and optimization will also help spread the video&apos;s message. Follow these steps to enhance your
                videos and improve their rankings... &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Shorter Videos Rank Better&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                No big surprise here -- the file size of short videos is much smaller than that of longer videos. On the
                video networks like YouTube, short videos are viewed far more often than longer ones. A length of less
                than 3 minutes per video seems to be ideal, and absolutely make every effort to keep your video under 10
                minutes! If you have a long video segment, consider breaking it into multiple videos. The more popular
                videos on the video networks are given more exposure, which will also help increase the number of views
                received.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Selecting an RSS Reader</title>
            <description>While many have resisted the urge to decipher the meaning behind the acronym RSS, the vast
                majority of technically knowledgeable online surfers have begun incorporating RSS into their daily
                routines. Why go through the hassle of understanding something new, the novice might want to know?
                Because it saves time, and time is a precious commodity these days.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The contents of an RSS feed can be read any number of ways. A variety of tools, both fee based and free,
                to read RSS feeds are available on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                When determining what RSS feed reader to download, thought should be given to security. More an more
                publishers are using RSS feeds as a way to deliver podcasts or media rich-content. Users of desktop
                software will want to find an RSS reader that allows for rich media to be delivered safely and securely.&lt;br

            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feeds to Locate Jobs</title>
            <description>In addition to actually seeking a job, there are also other valid reasons to monitor the job
                market. Perhaps you are satisfied in your current position, but just want to keep an eye on new
                positions in a specific sector. Perhaps you are just curious to know what the wages are for similar
                positions. The job market can be monitored quite easily using RSS feeds. You can subscribe to RSS feeds
                in order to find specific company job openings, employment available within a specific region (i.e. by
                using a postal or zipcode), specific positions available, or to locate all jobs within a specific wage

            <title>Lawyers Use RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Lawyers have never been known as a technical bunch, but more and more often you see a lawyer
                with a palm pilot making appointments and a blackberry for those urgent messages. Electronic gadgets are
                now common in the courthouses across the US. Lawyers have increased productivity by utilizing technology
                so it should come as no surprise that lawyers are using RSS feeds as a means to grow and manage their
                practices. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology
                they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Questioning Online Credibility</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a
                forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is
                in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the
                collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social
                bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Human nature invariably prompts a level of trust;if it is written, it must be true. We live in a
                generation where we expect authors, editors and publishers that are qualified to write on various
                topics. What qualifications are required to post a blog, write an online article, or edit a wiki? Some
                web surfers may find the answer startling: None. Expertise is no longer a prerequisite. Wikipedia is a
                popular online reference, that frequently obtains top ranking in search engines as a reference source.
                How many Wikipedia readers realize that Wikipedia can be edited by anyone at anytime, regardless of
                their qualifications. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Effective Podcast Tips</title>
            <description>Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing
                behind the show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a
                clean final product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best
                podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind the scenes
                is similar to what would take place for a radio show. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Females, in particular, should be cautious when circumnavigating the blogosphere. If you are a blogger
                or contemplating an online journal, consider these tips to protecting your identity: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS2HTML Pro</title>
            <description>The RSS2HTML Pro add on script expands the functionality of RSS2HTML by allowing publishers and
                webmasters to dynamically create an index of feed items. The RSS2HTML Pro script dynamically generates a
                separate web page for each item contained in the RSS feed. The script also creates an index of feed
                items as a separate web page. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                As with the RSS2HTML script the web pages dynamically update as the feed&apos;s item changes, meaning
                that the information displayed is always current. Additionally the contents of the web pages is able to
                be spidered by search engines. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Do I Need an RSS Feed?&lt;br /&gt;
                RSS has been around for more than 10 years but has only recently become popular. RSS provides headlines
                and summaries of information in a concise and standardized way. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This
                means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for
                webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Syndication &lt;br /&gt;
                Often, publishers, interested in expanding their base, will allow other webmasters to republish the
                contents of an RSS feed. Content providers that allow for syndication, receive additional exposure, and
                the webmasters serving the content, will generally see web traffic increase as a result of the new
                content. RSS feeds can be syndicated or displayed using a variety of different methods. Depending on the
                web host, server configuration, and the intent of the publishers, a variety of different syndication
                tools exist.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In most cases, providers convert RSS feeds to HTML in order to display the feeds contents. The following
                are some of the more popular methods to convert RSS feeds as web based content. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Works</title>
            <description>Podcasting is RSS that is used to syndicate and distribute audio files. Podcasting contains an
                audio file in the RSS feed&apos;s enclosure tag. An enclosure tag is used in RSS feeds to include
                certain types of files. The file contained in an enclosure tag can be: an image, a data file, a video
                file, or an audio file. Podcasting specifically refers to RSS feeds that contain audio files in their
                enclosure tag. The RSS version that currently supports enclosure tags is RSS version 2.0. All podcasts
                are currently created using this specification.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
                There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their
                exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general
                theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be
                interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest.
                Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in
                the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic
                and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Create Podcast Sermons &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were
                limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances.
                Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders
                that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost
                on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare
                to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme,
                parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers.
                Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and
                interested listeners.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help
                produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to it&apos;s
                full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and
                managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;br /&gt;
                In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own
                server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use
                to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>How Do I Promote My Podcast?</title>
            <description>There are a variety of things you can do to promote your podcast and increase its popularity...
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Auto-Discovery&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Include auto-discovery tags in the HTML header of the web page. Some podcasting and RSS readers will
                automatically detect that an RSS feed or podcast is available if such auto-discovery tags are included
                in the web page header tags.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS More Than Just News Headlines</title>
            <description>The core use for RSS is generally considered news headlines and blog syndication, but
                innovative businesses are learning to use RSS in different ways. Consider RSS as a communication channel
                that can provide current, targeted information as it appears within a very targeted audience.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Monitoring Newsgroups/Usenet &lt;br /&gt;
                Google Groups is a free online community and discussion group service that offers the Web&apos;s most
                comprehensive archive of Usenet postings. Google Groups can be monitored using RSS feeds. In order to
                monitor a specific newsgroup simply add &quot;/feed/msgs.xml&quot; to the end of the Google Group URL.
                Add the new URL to a newsgroup reader and receive updates each time a new post is added to the
                newsgroup. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Tips for Helping Your RSS Feed Perform!&lt;br /&gt;
                In some ways RSS is very similar to HTML, the language commonly used to create websites. Just as with
                HTML, webmasters using traditional search engine optimization tactics when creating an RSS feed will
                find that their RSS feed receives additional exposure and interest. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Content</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Podcasting content comes in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Businesses are finding many different and creative ways of incorporating podcasts into their business strategies and marketing plans. <br />
<br />
Here are just some of the various types of content that businesses are turning into podcasts... <br />
<br />
1. Audio Books<br />
<br />
Books that are "read" aloud are no longer embraced only by the visually impaired. For example, commuters who want to make the most of their travel time have long embraced books-on-tape. The podcast medium is far more compact and portable, so audio books and similar content are now being made available as podcasts. <br />
<br />
2. Audio Tours<br />
<br />
Interested in a guided tour of a historic site, or a detailed explanation of a museum display? Audio tour podcasts with detailed explanations are becoming quite common. <br />

            <title>Understanding RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS Feeds&lt;br /&gt;
                RSS also known as rich site summary or real simply syndication, arrived on the scene a number of years
                ago, but was only recently embraced by webmasters as a means to effectively syndicate content. RSS Feeds
                provide webmasters and content providers an avenue to provide concise summaries to prospective readers.
                Thousands of commercial web sites and blogs now publish content summaries in an RSS feed. Each item in
                the feed typically contains a headline; article summary and link back to the online article.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Benefit to the Webmaster &lt;br /&gt;
                As the web has become more crowded webmasters have been striving to provide fresh and up to date content
                for their website visitors. Many webmasters have discovered they can easily utilize the information in
                RSS feeds to provide fresh web content.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Personal Namespace Extension</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS
                feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the
                feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS
                readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Adding elements (tags) would typically only be used in an in-house solution where the writing
                application and the reading application have prior knowledge of the new tags. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Tips to Help Search Engine Optimization</title>
            <description>RSS feeds are a great communication medium, and when properly managed, web feeds can bring in
                significant Internet traffic. RSS feeds should contain compelling themed content with episodic titles
                that are united in common broad theme. Use RSS feeds as an online marketing and search engine
                optimization tool. Just as optimizing an HTML web page will increase exposure, so too will an RSS feed
                that is properly optimized and promoted. Use these simple tips to improve your web feed exposure. &lt;br

            <title>Configure RSS to HTML</title>
            <description>Before we begin, there are a few things you&apos;ll need to verify with whoever your web
                hosting provider is. First, does your web server support PHP?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Second, what is your FTP server?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Third, what are your login credentials for your FTP server?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com/videos/config-rss2html.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;

            <title>Free RSS to HTML Tool</title>
            <description>In addition to making your RSS feed available to your visitors for use with their RSS Feed
                Reader, as a webmaster you may also want to make the same feed available on your website for viewing
                with a regular web browser. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There are several ways to do this, some have advantages or disadvantages compared to others. The best
                solution is one where the webpage is automatically updated on-the-fly, is easily spidered by search
                engine robots, and easy to implement. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>Publicize your RSS feed. &lt;br /&gt;
                There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve
                made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;br /&gt;
                This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link
                popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS
                directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims.
                Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that
                blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous
                posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often
                do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Females, in particular, should be cautious when circumnavigating the blogosphere. If you are a blogger
                or contemplating an online journal, consider these tips to protecting your identity: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Royalty Free Tracks</title>
            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of
                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most
                cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another
                sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is Fair Use?</title>
            <description>As the Internet matures, users and governments are struggling to manage controversial issues.
                Lets face it, the Internet did not exist when the US copyright laws were written;let us not forget,
                while many countries respect copyright laws, the Internet is global without a governing body. There are
                not only different laws, rules and regulations, but also jurisdiction issues. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>You should not have to look far to find content or new ideas for your podcast show. Look to
                your daily sources to find fodder and ideas for new podcasting segments.&lt;br /&gt;
                1. News&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Question: Are there any size limitations to podcasts?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Answer: There are no maximums or minimums when it comes to podcast size. Obviously, the larger files
                might intimidate listeners with a slow connection. Podcasts can be successful at any size, generally
                wise podcasters balance the file size and the quality of their show. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Nothing really polishes a podcast more than background music or theme music. In the music
                world, these music segments are referred to as intros and extros. While many enjoy streaming Internet
                Audio and recording songs they like over the Internet, these songs cannot legally be used in a podcast.&lt;br

            <description>
                <![CDATA[Podcast Promotion<br />
Podcasting is a great new medium, but creating a podcast is only half of the work. Promoting a podcast is equally critical to it's success. <br />
<b></b><br />
<b>1. Educate the Public.</b><br />
It is important to remember that podcasting is a relatively new technology and not everyone understands or knows what podcasting is. It is particularly important to educate users if your audience is not technical. Not only is it important to explain what a podcast is, but it is equally important to explain how your podcast will help listeners. Instruction on how users can listen to podcasts should also be included.<br />

            <title>How Podcasting Works</title>
            <description>It has been said that in October of 2004 a Google search returned less than 6,000 results for
                the term &lt;i&gt;podcasting&lt;/i&gt;. Today, a similar search yields more than 857,000 results. Like
                the blogging phenomenon, podcasting has come out of nowhere and attracted an enthusiastic following.&lt;br
                /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                While some traditional radio talk shows have begun providing podcasts of their regularly-scheduled
                broadcasts, the bulk of the podcasts that have cropped up tend to be independent broadcasters who have a
                fascination with technology. As a result, some podcasts are a little rough around the edges.
                Nonetheless, it is clear that the technology provides a significant opportunity and potential. Even
                nay-sayers believe that podcasting is more than a passing fad.&lt;br /&gt;

                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most
                cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another
                sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Production and Use of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to
                emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but
                can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often
                synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate
                noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other
                emotions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Building an Image with a Logo</title>
            <description>Website design can be elusive to even creative individuals. Sadly some webmasters do not
                realize their incompetence and they post websites that have grainy graphics and turgid colors. If you
                are one of these webmasters and have seen the error of your ways, consider this. Your website is a sales
                tool. A professional layout and design can significantly increase sales and conversion rates, gaining
                you customers. Businesses can greatly benefit from a professional and unforgettable logo that sets them
                apart from their competition. Logos are not just fancy graphics that adorn websites or letterhead, logos
                are a representation of a businesses&apos; philosophy. Logos are a critical component of brand
                development.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Audio File Optimization</title>
            <description>Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website.
                Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet.
                Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings... &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Optimize Landing Page&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and
                encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to
                the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as
                possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to it&apos;s
                full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and
                managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;br /&gt;
                In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own
                server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use
                to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Etiquette for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The arguments continue to rage over the ambiguities in the RSS specifications. But the fact is:
                RSS is here to stay, and the current defined RSS 2.0 specification is likely going to be as good as it
                is going to get. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Filtering Script</title>
            <description>RSSFilter is a PHP script that filters the contents of an RSS feed. The filters can be defined
                by the publisher so that the resulting RSS feed contains only the information they want. RSSFilter uses
                rules to filter the items that are included from a feed in the resulting feed. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Syndication is conceptually simple. It allows publishers to distribute content that can be
                displayed in another location or context. Using RSS, publishers are able to easily create and
                disseminate content feeds that include news headlines, blog summaries and related links. RSS is the
                defined syndication standard that has become mainstream. All types of information are now available in a
                syndicated format.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of
                your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will
                contribute to it&apos;s success.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Location, Location, Location &lt;br /&gt;
                When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate
                location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and
                relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can
                remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
                There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their
                exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general
                theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be
                interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest.
                Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in
                the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic
                and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Can be Published Using RSS Feeds?</title>
            <description>With all the vast amounts of information available on the web, it is becoming more and more
                difficult to sort through and find what you are looking for. RSS significantly lowers the
                signal-to-noise ratio. RSS has the unique ability to compile information and filter it, so you only see
                unique and relevant content. The information superhighway has become packed with content, and those
                familiar with technology are using RSS to filter the content, allowing them to drill down and access
                only the content they want, without having to wade through all the noise. &lt;br /&gt;

                1. Plan Accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;
                When making the decision and commitment to podcast, it is important to think beyond the moment. Before
                starting, think about the time the podcast production will take. How will podcasting fit into a current
                schedule? How frequently will you podcast?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Advertising in RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>As publishers have moved towards monetizing RSS feeds, their have been vibrant discussions as
                to whether advertisements in feeds are viable or whether they will drive subscribers away. At the end of
                the day while it appears that many are discussing the philosophical approaches to ads in RSS feeds few
                are taking the time to examine the options available for inserting advertisements in feeds. Ultimately
                the advertisements served are going to determine the success of RSS as an advertising medium. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Innovation</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a new way to broadcast corporate news and structured
                information. RSS offers a quick, easy corporate communication channel. The RSS contents are published as
                a feed and the feed&apos;s content keep customers, partners and journalists abreast of corporate news
                and information. The RSS feeds are read using a tool referred to as a news aggregator, or an RSS reader.
                The aggregator periodically checks to see if the RSS feed has been updated. As the feed is updated, new
                information will automatically appear in the RSS reader. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Security</title>
            <description>RSS is growing at a lightening speed. What was once only known as a &lt;i&gt;techie tool,&lt;/i&gt;
                RSS is becoming a tool that is continuously being used by the general population. Along with the good
                comes, the not so good. And while some have mentioned the emergence of RSS spam, where content
                publishers dynamically generate nonsensical feeds stuffed with keywords, the real concern relates to
                security. While an annoyance to the search engines, spam in RSS feeds pales in comparison to the
                possible security concerns that could be in RSS future. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Content Syndication</title>
            <description>It is All About Content Syndication&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Creating Content&lt;br /&gt;
                New websites are being launched daily. In order to compete, webmasters need to find alternative ways of
                producing themed websites. Highly focused articles are often sought by wembasters. Why? Because content
                on the web is still king! In order to attract search engines and site visitors, webmasters rely heavily
                on providing new, innovative and fresh content. If the web site content is rich, visitors will come. If
                the website content is updated regularly, visitors will return. When evaluating a website&apos;s traffic
                it is easy to see that the low cost of syndicated content can increase a website&apos;s value. Sites
                that contain multiple pages related to a specific topic increase the likelihood of being &apos;found&apos;
                when a variety of search phrases are used for that topic.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve
                made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;br /&gt;
                This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link
                popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS
                directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds. Feeds are generally categorized and grouped
                together by subject. Web surfers looking for RSS feeds about a specific subject will often search the
                RSS directories, to locate a feed that matches their specific criteria. Topic specific RSS feed and
                podcasting directories are also emerging. Choose a web feed&apos;s category carefully and only submit
                relevant feeds to topic specific directories.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS2HTML Script</title>
            <description>In addition to making your RSS feed available to your visitors for use with their RSS Feed
                Reader, as a webmaster you may also want to make the same feed available on your website for viewing
                with a regular web browser. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There are several ways to do this, some have advantages or disadvantages compared to others. The best
                solution is one where the webpage is automatically updated on-the-fly, is easily spidered by search
                engine robots, and easy to implement. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                To attain this optimal solution, the developers of FeedForAll have created a free RSS to HTML PHP
                script, aptly named RSS2HTML. When used, this script will allow you to create webpages that will always
                display the most current information from your RSS feed, and because the resulting page is pure HTML, it
                will be in a format friendly to search engine robots.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Just Might Be the Tool to Revolutionize Education</title>
            <description>Schools all over the country have flocked to podcasting as a new medium to assist the teaching
                profession. Professors are using podcasts to instruct students and get their messages out. Podcasting is
                not restricted to one educational sector, professors at prestigious colleges from Bentley to Purdue have
                flocked to this medium.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Re-Using Content</title>
            <description>Repurposing content is not a terribly new concept. Webmasters that picked up on the trend have
                benefited from traffic surges for a while now. Repurposing content is all about presenting the same
                content in a variety of different ways, or using different mediums to present the same content.
                Webmasters can manipulate content in order to provide the same content in any number of different
                formats. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Why would publishers want to do this? There are a number of benefits to repurposing content, not the
                least of which is that it allows customers to select the format they wish to access your information.
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hallmarks of a Good Podcast</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[There are many, many things that separate a good podcast from all the rest. Here are a few to consider... <br />
Recording Quality<br />
<br />
The quality of the recording is probably the most critical component of a podcast. A good podcast is easy to understand, and should be recorded at a volume level that makes it easy for listeners to hear all that is said.<br />
<br />
<b>Sound Balance</b><br />
<br />
Adding background music polishes a podcast, but be careful that the music does not overpower the primary content. The background music should be subtle and not distracting. Create a balance that does not compromise the quality of the recording. Also, be sure that the music is not the focal point of a podcast show, unless the topic is about the music -- the emphasis should be on the primary content, and not on the musical arrangements.<br />

            <title>Podcasting for Business</title>
            <description>Regardless of the size of your business, or whether your company is public, private, a
                government agency, or a non-profit... there is little doubt that you should consider podcasting.
                Podcasting is a 21st century medium, and has proven that it is far more than just a passing fad.&lt;br /&gt;
                What is podcasting?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcasting is a relatively new communication medium. Podcasting&apos;s increasing popularity and low
                cost of entry makes it a great communication and promotional channel for companies to experiment with.&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Why Niche RSS Feeds Matter</title>
            <description>Just as the second generation of search engines and directories evolved into niche topic
                specific portals we are seeing the same occur in the area of RSS feed directories and search engines.
                While some directories are admittedly more niche than others the trend is obvious. &lt;br /&gt;
                Financial Industry&lt;br /&gt;
                If you are in the finance industry you can monitor currency exchange rates, bank rates and track
                investments using RSS feeds. Financial institutions have found RSS to be an optimum way to communicate
                CD rates, interest rates, currency conversions, and even investors are using to monitor stocks. Use RSS
                to track currency conversions, stocks, bonds, bank rates and other financial related information.&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Places to Get Ideas for Blog Posts</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. <br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: <br />
<br />
<b>1.Google News </b><br />
Monitor Google News for keywords related to your industry. If you find a story you disagree with or wholeheartedly agree with write about it. Add your thoughts, and editorialize the content. This does not mean you should just repost Google news summaries. The value is not only in the news aggregation, but in the commentary that you provide. Tie news items to specific events, conditions, or the impact of specific news on the industry. Adding a view point or reference to a news article adds genuine value. <br />

            <title>Audio File Optimization</title>
            <description>Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website.
                Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet.
                Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings... &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Optimize Landing Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and
                encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to
                the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as
                possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>RSSFilter is a PHP script that filters the contents of an RSS feed. The filters can be defined
                by the publisher so that the resulting RSS feed contains only the information they want. RSSFilter uses
                rules to filter the items that are included from a feed in the resulting feed. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Conduct a Podcast Interview</title>
            <description>Conducting a successful podcast interview can be a tricky proposition for a podcaster starting
                out. Once you have determined individuals that will appeal to your target audience contact potential
                interviewees and arrange a time to conduct the interview. Following this guide will insure that the
                interview goes off without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Prepare Questions in Advance &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Prepare a list of questions prior to the interview, contemplate possible follow-up questions based on
                the expected responses. Create a list of notes along with the questions that are accessible during the

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help
                produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Text to Podcast</title>
            <description>Instant Content; Converting a Text Article to a Podcast&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                We are taught to recycle paper, cans, bottles and plastic but marketers rarely discuss the value of
                repackaging and repurposing content. Publishers and marketers alike have embraced content syndication
                and RSS but few have considered the value beyond the actual syndication. Consider an alternative
                communication channel that reaches a new or different audience. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Repurposing and repackaging content or information so that it can be consumed through a variety of
                mediums is not a new concept. Many businesses today sight increased communication as a common goal. Cost
                conscious businesses with tight budges are often interested in minimizing work loads and cost, while
                increasing communication. By presenting the same information in different ways and formats, businesses
                are able to increase the reach and communication, while remaining cost conscious. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS Feeds to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This
                means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for
                webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Etiquette for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The arguments continue to rage over the ambiguities in the RSS specifications. But the fact is:
                RSS is here to stay, and the current defined RSS 2.0 specification is likely going to be as good as it
                is going to get. Attempts have been made to create &quot;best practice&quot; documents and specification
                clarifications. We felt it would be helpful to provide general guidelines for those constructing an RSS
                2.0 feed. In general, the following are guidelines for constructing an RSS feed. It is good to get into
                the habit of validating the RSS feed, either with software, or with an online validator. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Get Ideas for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these
                prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration
                originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Tools</title>
            <description>Considering the ever-increasing support for RSS in online communities, we have compiled a list
                of resources and products that will benefit webmasters, web surfers and publishers in their quest to
                understand the power of RSS. RSS has rapidly become an alternative communication venue. In order to
                understand the full benefits, consider utilizing some of the following tools and resources. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>FutureRSS</title>
            <description>The future-rss.php script is used to automatically delay the publication of Items in an RSS
                feed. This allows Items in a RSS feed to be created ahead of time, and then slowly released over a
                period of time. Many people have tried to set the PubDate field on their RSS feed Items to a future date
                and time, in an attempt to have that particular item become &apos;visible to their feeds subscribers on
                that particular date and time. Unfortunately, they will soon find out that many RSS readers and
                aggregators don&apos;t honor future PubDates, and immediately show all their feed&apos;s items. The
                future-rss.php script &apos;hides&apos; the future items from RSS feed readers and aggregators, until
                their PubDate becomes current. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Increase Your RSS Feed Subscribers</title>
            <description>Growing subscribers of your RSS feed will expand your reach. Put the appropriate effort into
                marketing your RSS feed, so you can increase adoption and spread the message contained in the RSS feed.&lt;br
                /&gt;
                Feed Validation&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Make sure that the feed is properly formed. Some RSS readers and aggregators will be unable to
                compensate or read an RSS feed that is not correctly formed. There are both web-based and desktop feed
                validation tools available that can help determine whether an RSS feed is properly formatted or not.
                After you edit the feed, be sure to spend a few minutes validating the feed. &lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt;
                The RSSmesh configuration is controlled by a configuration file for each feed to be produced.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>SQL2RSS</title>
            <description>The sql2rss.php script allows you to easily create rss feeds from SQL databases. The script
                currently supports the conversion of MySQL databases to RSS feeds. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                When using SQL2RSS the publisher has complete control over the content in the resulting RSS feed.
                Administrators and publishers control the database query which allows them the flexibility to determine
                what data is inserted into the RSS feeds from the database.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to it&apos;s
                full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and
                managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own
                server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use
                to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Social Bookmarking Tips</title>
            <description>&lt;b&gt;Good Things to Social Bookmark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                It can be tricky to predict what content will perform well on social bookmarking websites. The interests
                of our democratic populace are widespread and constantly changing. Webpages, podcasts, and images which
                are deemed more newsworthy, humorous, or intriguing often steal the spotlight. Knowing how to present
                content on social bookmarking websites can help internet marketers stand out.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>&lt;b&gt;Tips for Helping Your RSS Feed Perform!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                In some ways RSS is very similar to HTML, the language commonly used to create websites. Just as with
                HTML, webmasters using traditional search engine optimization tactics when creating an RSS feed will
                find that their RSS feed receives additional exposure and interest. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing
                effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs
                were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it
                has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Do People Unsubscribe?</title>
            <description>Whether you do email marketing, publish an RSS feed, or both, you will inevitably have
                customers that choose to unsubscribe from your communications. However, you may be able to limit the
                number of customers who do so. According to a recent report by ExactTarget, there are a variety of
                reasons why a person may unsubscribe. By understanding why customers unsubscribe from various
                communications, marketers can learn which marketing mistakes to avoid and keep their subscribers. &lt;br

            <title>RSS Feeds to Locate Jobs</title>
            <description>Using RSS Feeds To Locate Jobs&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In addition to actually seeking a job, there are also other valid reasons to monitor the job market.
                Perhaps you are satisfied in your current position, but just want to keep an eye on new positions in a
                specific sector. Perhaps you are just curious to know what the wages are for similar positions. The job
                market can be monitored quite easily using RSS feeds. You can subscribe to RSS feeds in order to find
                specific company job openings, employment available within a specific region (i.e. by using a postal or
                zipcode), specific positions available, or to locate all jobs within a specific wage range.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is Fair Use?</title>
            <description>As the Internet matures, users and governments are struggling to manage controversial issues.
                Lets face it, the Internet did not exist when the US copyright laws were written;let us not forget,
                while many countries respect copyright laws, the Internet is global without a governing body. There are
                not only different laws, rules and regulations, but also jurisdiction issues. RSS did not exist when
                copyright laws were written either. While ardent supporters feel any content in a feed can be
                syndicated, other equally fervent publishers contend that original works are just that--original works,
                and in many countries protected by copyright laws. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Realtors Estate and RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Why Should Realtors Use RSS?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is little argument that RSS can and will generate web traffic. Realtors using RSS feeds will
                increase the traffic to their website, and more web traffic means more potential buyers. RSS feeds will
                expand a realtor&apos;s reach and distribution, meaning that Realtors will reach new audiences using RSS
                feeds. RSS reaches areas through syndication that are just not as accessible through normal channels or
                traditional realty advertising. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Instant Content; Converting a Text Article to a Podcast&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                We are taught to recycle paper, cans, bottles and plastic but marketers rarely discuss the value of
                repackaging and repurposing content. Publishers and marketers alike have embraced content syndication
                and RSS but few have considered the value beyond the actual syndication. Consider an alternative
                communication channel that reaches a new or different audience. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Repurposing and repackaging content or information so that it can be consumed through a variety of
                mediums is not a new concept. Many businesses today sight increased communication as a common goal. &lt;br

            <title>How to Get Ideas for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Schools all over the country have flocked to podcasting as a new medium to assist the teaching
                profession. Professors are using podcasts to instruct students and get their messages out. Podcasting is

            <title>Quick Questions About Podcasting</title>
            <description>Podcasting is an up-and-coming and increasingly popular medium for communication. The following
                are common questions about podcasting, perfect for those just getting started in podcasting as a
                communication channel...&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What Format Should I Record To? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                While other formats are supported, MP3 is by far the most common format used for audio podcasts. Unless
                there is a specific and compelling reason to use a different format, you should stick with MP3 files for
                audio podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a

                podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that
                rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can&apos;t even be heard
                clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts.
                To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To
                help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and
                copyright law. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>Publicize your RSS feed. &lt;br /&gt;
                There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve
                made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link
                popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The rss2sql.php script allows you to easily create SQL databases from RSS feeds. The script
                currently supports the conversion of RSS feeds to MySQL databases. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The core use for RSS is generally considered news headlines and blog syndication, but
                innovative businesses are learning to use RSS in different ways. Consider RSS as a communication channel

            <title>What Exactly is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>The term &lt;i&gt;podcast&lt;/i&gt; was initially used to reference an RSS feed that contained
                audio files in the items enclosure field. The meaning of podcasting has since expanded, and now refers
                to RSS feeds that contain all types of media, including audio and video, in the item&apos;s enclosure
                field. For the non-technical folks, podcasting is simply a means of syndicating and distributing
                rich-media files via the Internet. The content contained in a podcast can vary significantly, from a
                song, to a educational lecture, to a political debate, to just about anything else. One great thing
                about podcasting is the wide variety of content formats it can contain. And unlike radio or television
                broadcasts, the recipient can listen or view at their leisure, choosing for themselves when and where
                they wish to listen or view a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
            <description>Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available
                to them? Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians
                be the victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use
                of the technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in
                today&apos;s society. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting websites,
                indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections. Technology could be the
                deciding factor in the 2008 US Presidential race, and while distribution has never before been as
                accessible as it is to today&apos;s politicians and political candidates, politicians have far less
                control over the news and media than their counterparts in previous years. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are
                considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has
                grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and
                reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details
                appropriate behavior. That does not mean there are not acceptable and unacceptable actions that bloggers
                should take. In order to efficiently communicate as a blogger on the Internet, it is critical to
                understand the unwritten rules of blogging etiquette.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Steps to Creating and Promoting RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication as it is commonly known, is a technology that gives
                webmasters the ability to easily distribute and publish syndicated content on the Internet. It seems
                like all Internet businesses now have RSS feeds available; at least your competitors do. You have
                finally made the decision that you have to have one. Where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Good Things to Social Bookmark&lt;br /&gt;
                It can be tricky to predict what content will perform well on social bookmarking websites. The interests
                of our democratic populace are widespread and constantly changing. Webpages, podcasts, and images which
                are deemed more newsworthy, humorous, or intriguing often steal the spotlight. Knowing how to present
                content on social bookmarking websites can help internet marketers stand out.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Tips to a Great Podcasting Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help
                produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Do People Unsubscribe</title>
            <description>Whether you do email marketing, publish an RSS feed, or both, you will inevitably have
                customers that choose to unsubscribe from your communications. However, you may be able to limit the
                number of customers who do so. According to a recent report by ExactTarget, there are a variety of
                reasons why a person may unsubscribe. By understanding why customers unsubscribe from various
                communications, marketers can learn which marketing mistakes to avoid and keep their subscribers. &lt;br

            <title>RSS2HTML Pro</title>
            <description>The RSS2HTML Pro add on script expands the functionality of RSS2HTML by allowing publishers and
                webmasters to dynamically create an index of feed items. The RSS2HTML Pro script dynamically generates a
                separate web page for each item contained in the RSS feed. The script also creates an index of feed
                items as a separate web page. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                As with the RSS2HTML script the web pages dynamically update as the feed&apos;s item changes, meaning
                that the information displayed is always current. Additionally the contents of the web pages is able to
                be spidered by search engines. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sound Effects; The Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be
                podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically
                non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a
                podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound
                effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find
                on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Most podcasters and producers do not have the time or equipment to go out and record all the sound
                effects they may want to incorporate into their production. Podcasters are better off using royalty-free
                sound effects. Royalty-free sound effects are purchased, and there is no recurring fee for the use of
                the effect. The purchaser may use the sound effect(s) as often as required within the license terms and
                conditions, without paying for the use of the sound effect each time the effect is used. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Royalty Free Tracks</title>
            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of
                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most
                cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another
                sound.&lt;br /&gt;

<br />
<b>1. Optimize Landing Page</b><br />
<b></b><br />
Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. <br />

            <title>RSS Filter</title>
            <description>RSSFilter is a PHP script that filters the contents of an RSS feed. The filters can be defined
                by the publisher so that the resulting RSS feed contains only the information they want. RSSFilter uses
                rules to filter the items that are included from a feed in the resulting feed. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Converting RSS to HTML&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This means that
                the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for webmasters to
                serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hallmarks of a Good Podcast</title>
            <description>There are many, many things that separate a&lt;i&gt; good&lt;/i&gt; podcast from all the rest.
                Here are a few to consider... &lt;br /&gt;
                Recording Quality&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The quality of the recording is probably the most critical component of a podcast. A good podcast is
                easy to understand, and should be recorded at a volume level that makes it easy for listeners to hear
                all that is said.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Personal Namespace Extensions</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS
                feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the
                feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS
                readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br

            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has
                become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology
                they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast
                and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound
                quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast
                structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or
                break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help
                produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>What is Podcasting&lt;br /&gt;
                Podcasting is quickly becoming a buzz word among the techie crowd. So what is podcasting, anyway?
                Podcasting is online audio content that is delivered via an RSS feed. Many people liken podcasting to
                radio on demand. However, in reality, podcasting gives far more options in terms of content and
                programming than radio does. In addition, with Podcasting, listeners can determine the time and the
                place, meaning they decide what programming they want to receive and when they want to listen to it.
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Listeners can retain audio archives to listen to at their leisure. While blogs have turned many bloggers
                into journalists, podcasting has the potential to turn podcasters into radio personalities. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Is Used</title>
            <description>Although podcasting is new, it is well on its way to becoming a mainstream communication
                medium. Podcasting, simply put, is audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe that
                podcasting is solely for the distribution of music files, but really, nothing could be further from the
                truth. This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and
                communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are
                technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses
                are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk
                shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign
                language tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Understanding RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS also known as rich site summary or real simply syndication, arrived on the scene a number
                of years ago, but was only recently embraced by webmasters as a means to effectively syndicate content.
                RSS Feeds provide webmasters and content providers an avenue to provide concise summaries to prospective
                readers. Thousands of commercial web sites and blogs now publish content summaries in an RSS feed. Each
                item in the feed typically contains a headline; article summary and link back to the online article.&lt;br
                /&gt;

            <description>RSSFilter is a PHP script that filters the contents of an RSS feed. The filters can be defined
                by the publisher so that the resulting RSS feed contains only the information they want. RSSFilter uses
                rules to filter the items that are included from a feed in the resulting feed. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Do I Get Ideas for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do
                these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their
                inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web
                content. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is Fair Use</title>
            <description>As the Internet matures, users and governments are struggling to manage controversial issues.
                Lets face it, the Internet did not exist when the US copyright laws were written;let us not forget,
                while many countries respect copyright laws, the Internet is global without a governing body. There are
                not only different laws, rules and regulations, but also jurisdiction issues.&lt;br /&gt;

                communication. Podcasting, simply put, are audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe

                communication opportunities to businesses.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Tutorial</title>
            <description>Podcasting is simply distributing audio content using RSS. The process is suprisingly simple,
                and by making audio content available using RSS, podcasters give listeners more control over what they
                listen to and when. Also, many podcasts are available for syndication, which increases a broadcasters
                exposure. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to
                emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but
                can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Questioning Credibility Online</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a
                forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is
                in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the
                collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social
                bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>It has been said that in October of 2004 a Google search returned less than 6,000 results for
                the term &lt;i&gt;podcasting&lt;/i&gt;. Today, a similar search yields more than 857,000 results. Like
                the blogging phenomenon, podcasting has come out of nowhere and attracted an enthusiastic following.&lt;br

                Reader, as a webmaster you may also want to make the same feed available on your website for viewing
                with a regular web browser. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There are several ways to do this, some have advantages or disadvantages compared to others. The best
                solution is one where the webpage is automatically updated on-the-fly, is easily spidered by search

            <description>The arguments continue to rage over the ambiguities in the RSS specifications. But the fact is:
                RSS is here to stay, and the current defined RSS 2.0 specification is likely going to be as good as it
                is going to get. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Sermons</title>
            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents
                were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving
                distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders
                that communities have become accustom to.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Deconstructing RSS</title>
            <description>Selecting and utilizing appropriate keywords is a critical step in Web design. If your Web site
                and meta tags do not contain related keywords, web surfers will be unable to find you through search
                engines, which use keywords to index sites.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                The formula is a little tricky — you will need to locate terms that are popular and relevant to your
                site. These terms may or may not be terms that you feel are relevant terms. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Some of the best podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation

                your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will
                contribute to its success.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve
                made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;

                <![CDATA[<b>Podcast Promotion</b><br />
Podcasting is a great new medium, but creating a podcast is only half of the work. Promoting a podcast is equally critical to it's success. <br />
<br />
<b>1. Educate the Public.</b><br />
It is important to remember that podcasting is a relatively new technology and not everyone understands or knows what podcasting is. It is particularly important to educate users if your audience is not technical. <br />

            <title>SQL2RSS</title>
            <description>The sql2rss.php script allows you to easily create rss feeds from SQL databases. The script
                currently supports the conversion of MySQL databases to RSS feeds. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                When using SQL2RSS the publisher has complete control over the content in the resulting RSS feed.
                Administrators and publishers control the database query which allows them the flexibility to determine
                what data is inserted into the RSS feeds from the database.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This
                means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for
                webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br

            <title>Really Simple Success</title>
            <description>In search engine optimization, great content increases the likelihood of your website receiving
                and maintaining a high search engine rank, which ultimately drives qualified traffic and leads to your
                company&apos;s website. But great content requires great distribution to really shine.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Placing your content in front of the right customers at the right time is critical, especially when your
                customers and prospects have so many choices online for learning about the exact same products and
                services you sell. While there are many ways to drive traffic to your website, one of the more
                successful methods--syndication--also happens to be one of the most cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Syndication is conceptually simple. It allows publishers to distribute content that can be
                displayed in another location or context. Using RSS, publishers are able to easily create and
                disseminate content feeds that include news headlines, blog summaries and related links. RSS is the
                defined syndication standard that has become mainstream. All types of information are now available in a
                syndicated format.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without
                the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time,
                that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for
                musicians.&lt;br /&gt;

<b>Podcasts and Copyrights</b><br />
Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can't even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. <br />

<b>Why Over Sharing Might Be Hurting You</b><br />
We all know someone who divulges a little too much information on the Internet. Whether it's the friend who Instagrams every meal or the relative who constantly posts updates on how Fido's doing, this phenomenon seems well on its way to pervading all the social media we use. Maybe you have even caught yourself posting a bit too much. While something that everyone seems to be doing may appear harmless enough, oversharing can have some negative consequences of which all social media users should take note. <br />

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a
                humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared
                in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common
                place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Do People Unsubscribe?</title>
            <description>Whether you do email marketing, publish an RSS feed, or both, you will inevitably have
                customers that choose to unsubscribe from your communications. However, you may be able to limit the
                number of customers who do so. According to a recent report by ExactTarget, there are a variety of
                reasons why a person may unsubscribe. By understanding why customers unsubscribe from various
                communications, marketers can learn which marketing mistakes to avoid and keep their subscribers. &lt;br

            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of
                vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with
                acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully,
                royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
            <description>The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting
                websites, indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available to them?
                Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians be the
                victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use of the
                technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in todays
                society. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Questioning Online Credibility</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a
                forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is
                in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the
                collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social
                bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What RSS is Not...</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[It is difficult to have a conversation about technology these days that does not involve RSS. In the age of the Internet, communication is expected to be instantaneous. RSS offers instant real-time distribution in an on demand world. <br />
<br />
<b>What is RSS? </b><br />
RSS is a standard format for syndicating information or content over the Internet. Once a visitor subscribes to an RSS feed, they receive the new information each time the feed is updated. <br />
<br />
<b>RSS Does Not Equal Email</b><br />
RSS is not email, nor is it designed to be a replacement for email. RSS is a supplemental communication channel that can be used to deliver content.<br />

            <title>Set Your Podcast Up for Success</title>
            <description>Podcasting Tips &lt;br /&gt;
                As podcasts increase in popularity, listeners have more choices. So while you might be ahead of the
                competition, you should still be thinking about ways that you can make your podcast unique and stand out
                from similarly themed podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Plan Accordingly. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                When making the decision and commitment to podcast, it is important to think beyond the moment. Before
                starting, think about the time the podcast production will take. How will podcasting fit into a current
                schedule? How frequently will you podcast? &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt;
                Purpose: The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS
                feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the
                feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS
                readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging
                provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The
                details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has
                become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasts and Copyrights</title>
            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a
                means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can
                podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that
                rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can not even be heard
                clearly.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>PowerPoint Podcasting Tutorial</title>
            <description>PowerPoint presentations can be included in RSS feeds as an enclosure. The process is
                suprisingly simple, and by making PowerPoints available using RSS, publishers give viewers of what they
                watch and when. Also, many podcasts are available for syndication, which increase the exposure
                presentations will recieve. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[For those of you who already know what XML namespaces are, and just want to know how FeedForAll supports them, pleases skip ahead to the Extensions in FeedForAll Section.<br />
<br />
For the rest, this section is for you. First of all, what are RSS Extensions? Well, technically they are called <i>XML Namespaces, </i>but we will call them <i> RSS Extensions</i>, or just <i>'xtensions</i>, in most of this document, mainly because we will be talking about how namespaces specifically apply to RSS feeds, and extends their capabilities. <br />

            <title>Consumer Education</title>
            <description>Consumer education is something many small software companies tend to overlook. While the
                benefits of consumer education may not always be obvious, the fact of the matter is that educated
                customers are good customers, and happier customers. A customer who does not understand an application&apos;s
                capabilities or features is more likely to experience frustration with it, making them less satisfied
                with your product and also potentially draining your support time. Therefore, we&apos;ve created a brief
                guide to consumer education to help you enhance your business.&lt;br /&gt;

                great advances that have been made in smart phone technology, most of us rely on our phones to help us
                in an array of situations. While most smart phone owners are acquainted with the helpfulness of features
                such as navigation apps and mobile broadband, many people have yet to discover the array of uses they
                may put their phones to in the event of a true emergency. We have compiled a list of 10 things your
                phone can do in an emergency to shed light on this exciting and important realm of development:&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sound Effects the Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Most podcasters and producers do not have the time or equipment to go out and record all the
                sound effects they may want to incorporate into their production. Podcasters are better off using
                royalty-free sound effects. Royalty-free sound effects are purchased, and there is no recurring fee for
                the use of the effect. The purchaser may use the sound effect(s) as often as required within the license
                terms and conditions, without paying for the use of the sound effect each time the effect is used. &lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are
                considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has
                grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and
                reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details
                appropriate behavior. &lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;br /&gt;
                Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online
                bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are
                becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting
                guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not
                consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Create a Personal Namespace</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements tags in any RSS
                feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the
                feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS
                readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br
                /&gt;

            <title>How Do I Promote My Podcast?</title>
            <description>There are a variety of things you can do to promote your podcast and increase its popularity...
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;1. Auto-Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Include auto-discovery tags in the HTML header of the web page. Some podcasting and RSS readers will
                automatically detect that an RSS feed or podcast is available if such auto-discovery tags are included
                in the web page header tags. &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Optimize an RSS Feed for Search Engines</title>
            <description>In some ways RSS is very similar to HTML, the language commonly used to create websites. Just
                as with HTML, webmasters using traditional search engine optimization tactics when creating an RSS feed
                will find that their RSS feed receives additional exposure and interest.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Crowd Sourcing and Social Media</title>
            <description>It seems that our society is growing ever more dependent on social media; more and more people
                are joining social networking giants such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and more such websites
                and applications are springing up to meet the rising demand for them. As society and culture continue
                this turn towards technology, so do the operations of society, especially through crowdsourcing. A
                powerful tool, crowdsourcing does much good, but has also caused a number of problems. In such a
                situation, one must ask: do the benefits of crowdsourcing really outweigh the risks.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
